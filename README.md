Most Of Project ERA Archived Launchers

NOTE: this is not intentional to harm project era or make them mad. i do this only because era is shutting down and if pepole wanna do some stuff with it idc


those Era launchers should work with either lawin or fiddler. except for the "FMPCLIENT.rar" this can be used to multiplayer such as reboot etc... the other launchers are single player only!

the era.dll is the dll for era first release! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N6hlD1DcHE&t=324s     this is a video made by Mineluke that shows that dll.


Era If u are seeing this i posted this to remind pepole of good era now that its shutting down. i dont mean any harm.
